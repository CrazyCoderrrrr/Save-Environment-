        <h1>Hi!</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>We live in a God-gifted world, but humans are the reason behind the deterioration of the environment. Everything that surrounds us constitutes the environment. The earth is made up of various environments in which all living and non-living things coexist. Nature’s biological, physical and natural forces interact to generate conditions that allow creatures to survive. The environment is a term used to describe such circumstances. A derivative of the word environment is the French word ‘environ,’ which means ‘to surround.’ The environment is made up of all biotic (living) and abiotic (non-living) things. Plants, animals, human beings, and insects are examples of biotic components. They are classified as biological environmental components. Every living thing has a predetermined life cycle. The human being, for example, is the most powerful living entity on the planet. To meet his needs, he requires plants and animals. Without these components, the life of human beings will be disordered. The atmosphere, lithosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere are all examples of abiotic/physical components. The atmosphere is a gaseous layer containing nitrogen, oxygen, and other gases. The hydrosphere is made up of all the water bodies, such as rivers and oceans. The lithosphere is the earth’s solid outer shell. It is composed of the crust, covering the earth’s mantle, rocks, and soil. The biosphere, where life exists, is the most essential layer. There are ecosystems in the water, on land, and in the air.</p>

        <p>All of these species’ lives are predicated on their ongoing interaction with one another. Their functioning is organised by nature, and once spent, it might be eliminated. The destruction of the environment has now become a big issue that humans must address.</p>
      
        <h1>What is Danger to Environment ?</h1>

        <p>Our Mother Earth is currently facing a lot of environmental threats and the only way to survive the crisis is to talk and think about the problems honestly and seriously.

Our environment is constantly changing. There is no denying that. However, as the environment changes, so does the need for increasing considerations to resolve the problems.

Global warming is definitely one of the main environmental issues that we are dealing with. The earth is getting warmer and we, as humans, are responsible for a large part of this problem.

However, global warming is not the only problem we have to worry about. Around the world, people face various challenges on a daily basis. Some of these problems are minor and affect only a limited part of the ecosystem. But most of them are so dangerous and threatening that they change the nature we remember.

Our planet has been poisoned and is on the brink of an environmental crisis. The current environmental problems have made us so vulnerable that disaster lurks around the corner. Our planet is in a state of emergency. The only way to survive the crisis is to talk and think about the problems honestly and seriously. The current environmental issues require immediate attention!</p>
    
        <h2>1. Pollution</h2>
        <p>It takes millions of years to eliminate air, water and soil pollution. The exhaust gas from vehicles and factories are at the forefront of air pollution. Air pollution comes from the gases that factories and industries produce from burning fossil fuels. Soil pollution happens when industrial waste is added to the soil and deprives it of nutrients. Heavy metals, nitrates, and plastics are toxic substances that also cause pollution.</p>
        <h2>2. Population Growth</h2>
        <p>World Population growth has reached a critical threshold, resulting in a shortage of resources such as water, fuel and food. The exploded population in less developed and developing countries are devouring the scarce resources. Uncontrolled agricultural activities, use of fertilizers, insecticides and pesticides have damaged the environment.</p>
        <p>Of all of the environmental challenges facing the planet today, overpopulation is often neglected. As consumers increase, so does the need for natural resources to feed them.</p>
        <h2>3. Global Warming</h2>
        <p>Human activity causes climate change, including global warming, resulting in greenhouse gas emissions. Global warming increases the temperature of the oceans and the surface of the earth, resulting in the melting ice from both poles. The result is an increase in sea levels and the creation of abnormal weather patterns such as severe floods, heavy snowfall or desertification.</p>
        <h2>4. Depletion of Natural Resources</h2>
        <p>Lack of natural resources is another issue to consider while examining the reasons for environmental threats. Total fossil fuel consumption is currently reaching its highest level possible, leading to nothing but climate change and global warming. Around the world, people are turning to use renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, biological gases and geothermal energy. The cost to build and maintain the infrastructure of these resources has dropped dramatically in recent years.</p>
        <h2>5. Waste</h2>
        <p>Overuse of resources and the creation of plastic is a major problem for the earth. Developed countries are notorious for producing large amounts of waste and dumping it into the oceans. Nuclear energy waste is the most dangerous of these wastes, causing many health issues. Plastic waste, fast food, electronic packaging and microprocessors threaten human life. Waste is one of the most dangerous environmental threats around the globe.</p>
        <h2>6. Climate Change</h2>
        <p>Climate change is another environmental threat that has its origins back in past decades. This problem is caused by global warming, which itself is the result of rising atmospheric temperatures due to the production of toxic gases in factories and fossil fuels. Climate change has many serious effects not limited to polar ice melting, changing seasons, the emergence of new diseases, successive floods and changing climate flows.</p>
        <h2>7. Deforestation</h2>
        <p>Forests are a critical absorber of carbon dioxide and produce fresh oxygen. They also contribute to climate regulation and precipitation. Currently, forests cover about 30 percent of the land surface but are being lost every year as the population grows and people need more food, housing and clothing.</p>
        <h2>8. Ozone Depletion</h2>
        <p>The Ozone Layer is an invisible protective layer that surrounds the Earth and protects us from harmful sun rays. Chlorine- and bromine-containing chemicals destroy ozone molecules. As these toxic gases reach the top of the atmosphere, they create a hole in the ozone layer, the largest of which is located above Antarctica. In many industries and consumer products, the use of CFCs is banned. Because the ozone layer prevents harmful UV rays from reaching the Earth’s surface.</p>
        <h2>9. Biodiversity Loss</h2>
        <p>Human activities have led to the extinction of species and the loss of different kinds of climates worldwide. The ecosystem, which has been struggling for its current maturity for millions of years, finds itself at risk of biodiversity loss. The pollination process is vital to the survival of the ecosystem, and human activities are the greatest threat to this process. Another example is the destruction of coral reefs in many oceans on which marine life depends.</p>
        <p>Biodiversity is vital for human health and well-being. The United Nations marks May 22 as International Day for Biological Diversity to raise public awareness and understanding about biodiversity issues, its values and the steps taken to preserve this valuable treasure. The theme of the 2019 edition was “Our Biodiversity, Our Food, Our Health”.</p>
        <h2>10. Ocean Acidification</h2>
        <p>Ocean acidification is caused mainly by the consumption of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, leading to the lower PH of the ocean over a long period of time. According to a research published in Nature Climate Change, ScienceDaily, ocean acidification “not only impacts the behaviour of individual species but also the wider marine ecosystems which are influenced by them.”</p>
        <p>The acidity of the oceans has been on the rise over the past 250 years, however, it will even get worse by 150 percent until 2100. The impact of this event is a threat to the life of crustaceans and planktons and will lead to osteoporosis in humans.</p>
        <h2>11. Acid Rain</h2>
        <p>Acid rain is recognized as one of the most serious ecological threats we face today, causing various health, including respiratory diseases, and environmental problems. This phenomenon is a result of the presence of certain pollutants in the atmosphere, burning of fossil fuels, volcanic eruptions or decay of plants, during which Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) penetrate deep into the atmosphere.</p>
        <h2>12. Water Pollution</h2>
        <p>You must have heard about the “War on Water” predicted to happen in the future. water scarcity has been a topic of movies and books in recent years, for example, Christopher Nolan’s Interstellar and Jake Paltrow’s Young Ones, but Mad Max is a step further in Hollywood’s campaign to educate audiences about the world’s water crisis.</p>
        <p>In literature, you can also see many examples of educating people to be careful about this imminent crisis. British poet W. H. Auden said about a hundred years ago that, “Thousands have lived without love, not one without water.”</p>
        <p>Clean water is now a scarce commodity. Our rivers, seas and oceans are no longer safe from toxic or hazardous pollutants due to industrial development posing a threat to human health.</p>
        <p>Water is becoming a political and economic issue because in the future people will have to fight with each other on the water to survive. One of the suggested solutions to this problem is sea-sweetening. Industrial pollutants are filling the rivers, seas and oceans with toxic pollutants that have become a serious threat to human health.</p>
        <h2>13. Urban Spawl</h2>
        <p>Urbanization means the expansion of the migration of residents in crowded areas to rural areas and transforming them into urban areas. This process leads to soil erosion, increased traffic and environmental and health problems. This increasing demand for urbanization leads to the elimination of the process of replacing vegetation and animal cover.</p>
        <h2>14. Genetic Engineering</h2>
        <p>The term genetic engineering is used to describe the process by which the genetic makeup of an organism can be altered using “recombinant DNA technology.” Genetic modification of food by biological technology is called genetic engineering. Genetic modification of the food leads to the transmission of toxic substances and diseases from a plant to another. Genetic modification has many problems. Engineered genes may transfer toxic samples into the environment. Another problem is that by making plants resistant to insects, we create organisms that are resistant to antibiotics.</p>

        <br>
        <p class="p2">John Muir was born on 21 April ,1838 in Dunbar in East Lothian, Scotland. He emigrated with his family to America in 1849. He died aged 76.He is known as John of the Mountains and the Father of America’s national park, as well as patron saint of the American wilderness.His activism helped to preserve the Yosemite Valley, Sequoia National Park and other wilderness areas in America.John founded the Sierra Club, which is an acclaimed American conservation organization. In September 1867, John walked 1000 miles from Indiana to Florida, which he recounted in his book, A Thousand-Mile Walk to the Gulf. He had no specific route chosen, except to go by the "wildest, leafiest, and least trodden way I could find”.The 211-mile (340 km) John Muir Trail, a hiking trail in the Sierra Nevada, was named in his honor. Many other places in America take John Muir’s name including Muir Woods National Monument, Muir Beach, John Muir College and Mount Muir all in California.John Muir is considered “an inspiration to both Scots and Americans”. Muir's biographer, Steven J. Holmes, believes Muir has become "one of the patron saints of 21st century American environmental activity," both political and recreational.On April 21, 2013, the first ever John Muir Day was celebrated in Scotland, which marked the 175th anniversary of his birth.</p>

        <h2 class="Cursive">Sunderlal Bahuguna</h2>
        <br>
        <p class="p2">Sunderlal Bahuguna (9th January, 1927-21st May, 2021), the chief leader of Chipko movement was a true follower of Gandhian ideology and joined in the Indian freedom movement under the leader-ship of Shridev Suman, an ardent Gandhian follower who strongly believed in the premise - Charkha as the sign of soul force for bringing Indian independence. In 1944 i.e., in pre-independent period Bahuguna was arrested by the British Government when he wrote in the newspapers against the torture inflicted, in jail, upon Shridev Suman who was arrested when he protested against the king’s repression in Tehri Garhwal. Though Shridev Suman was died in jail after a long fasting for 84 days, Bahuguna was shifted to the Nagendra Nagar jail where he was fed food with a mixing of Kerosine oil and become seriously ill. However, he was released, on conditioned, from the jail custody after the advice of the doctor to the jailor. Later on, i.e., in post-independence period, he spent his entire life for saving the ecology and thus become a real ideal environmentalist for saving the mother earth by heart and soul following the path introduced by Gandhian ethics. This article is, actually, an elaboration cum analysis of the works done by Sunderlal Bahuguna, reflected on the mirrors of environmental ethics, especially, Gandhian ethics following these subsections: (i) Environment & its meaning, (ii) Environment and Western Ethics (Anthropocentricism, Non-anthropocentricism, Land ethics of Aldo Leopold & Deep Ecology of Arne Naess), (iii) Environment & Indian Tradition, (iv) Gandhian ethics, (v) Major environmental activities of Sunderlal Bahuguna, (vi) Conclusion -Sunderlal Bahuguna an architype of Gandhian ethics.</p>
